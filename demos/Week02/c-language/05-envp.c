/* Notes by Benedictus Alvin WK10
 * In the beginning this program defined a main method with argc,argv, and envp as parameters
 * and constant variable named MAXLOOP and MAXLENG
 * ARGC (argument counter) is represents the number of things that you entered into the 
 * command line when running this program on a terminal
 * ARGV (argument vector) is an array that holds the string values of the things that 
 * were entered on the command line when running this program
 * ENVP (program environment) is an array of strings that consists a list of the environment 
 * variables of your shell
 * When you run this program, this program will print your program environtment on your console
 * This program will only print as many as 15 environtment (envp[0] - envp[14]) according to 
 * the limit (MAXLOOP) and the environtment length is only 60 (MAXLENG)
 * Char 57 to 59 will be replaced with X (line 20-22) and the rest will not be printed
